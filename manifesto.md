The strength of my work is often obscured by the structure of my language itself. This is not a theoretical manifesto, but a pragmatic one. I acknowledge that the simple pleasures of leather, science, and fur have influenced my trajectory—elements I continue to dissect.
What matters more than play or personal interest is transfer: how something moves into language—not conventional language, but one scaffolded by the digital young. Cory Arcangel,  digital systems become both. I am drawn to the need to tangibilize digitally fabricated work—whether I am fully invested in Nutrition, fitness, and food in the background, while gravity pulls me to interrogate aesthetics. I often find myself severed to spatialized through such ironic form s of making.
I attempt to make these forces tangible, What happens if form is produced through lineage—generated, fragmented, and reassembled through the digital? There is a path, a split, an index, a series: X and Y coordinates, lists and sort orders, time units, Z values, curves, extrusions, gradients, custom previews, and finally the CSV. In proxy I demand the words and data are treated to not produce but to be reality in which three dimensions become 1 dimensions as we see it so I can stand on it once I can I will be able to simulate at which would be a csv of everything I BAN decoration im creating conditions through this There is certain columns that need to be followed by Constructed points which is my pedestal and so is this IDEA OF MERGE, CSV MERGE AND ISOLATE and CULL 

 There must be a simple blind spot here I wish for me to find
