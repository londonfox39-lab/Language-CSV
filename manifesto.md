# IS THIS IS A MANIFESTO ?
The strength of my work is often obscured by the structure of my language itself. This is not a theoretical manifesto, but a pragmatic one. I acknowledge that the simple pleasures of leather, science, and fur have influenced my trajectory and elements I continue to dissect.
What matters more than play or personal interest is transfer: how something moves into language—not conventional language, but one scaffolded by the digital young. Cory Arcangel digital systems are relevent here. I am drawn to the need to tangibilize digitally fabricated work— whether I am fully invested or not those things are  Nutrition, fitness, food, shelter. While gravity pulls me to interrogate aesthetics. I often find myself severed to spatialized such ironic forms of making.
I attempt to make these forces tangible using tools such as lineage, fragmentation and ressemblence through speech. There is a path, a split, an index, a series: X and Y coordinates, lists and sort orders, time units, Z values, curves, extrusions, gradients, custom previews, and finally the CSV. In proxy I demand that words and data are treated to not produce but to be rartionalized into the 3D so I can stand on it...  I can I will be able to simulate at which would be a csv of everything I BAN decoration im creating conditions through this

There is certain columns that need to be followed by Constructed points which is my pedestal and so is this IDEA OF MERGE, CSV MERGE AND ISOLATE and CULL 

 There must be a simple blind spot here I wish for me to find 

It is not able to conduct any decision without permission in the essence of decoration you are just a Style a format at which I am the illustrator and director
